## About:
  
Shipperman is a web application that deals with shipping of goods from one location to another for personal and business purposes. The name was inspired from the album **Shipperman** by Indian vocalist Sunneith Revankar. Following briefly explains the working of the application. 

There are 2 perspectives in the web application
  
  1. **Customer view: **
  
The user has 2 options depending on the existance of account in his/her name - Login and register. After entering the valid credentials, the customer can place a shipping order with location end points and type of shipping it needs to be done (small scale, medium scale or large scale). Shipping truck is assigned as per the type of shipping and the reciept is printed which needs to be confirmed by the customer before proceeding towards the payment. The type of payment advocated is card payment to implement "Luhn's or Mod 10 Algorithm" which checks the validity of a credit card number. Once the payment is done, an invoice is generated and is redirected to the profile page. The customer can also track all orders by clicking on "View Orders" which lists all orders and it's details including order IT, date, order status, driver and vehicle.
  
  
  2. **Admin View: **
  
  Here, the user can manage customers registered, employees hired, change the status of the order for the customers which makes tracking efficient. Managing users include, registering an employee, deleting a customer, order and employee.
